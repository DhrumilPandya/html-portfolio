<h1>The Best Movies According To Dhrumil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>“The Dark Knight” is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. 
    Batman is good, yes, The Joker is evil, yes. 
    But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and blaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. 
    And the Joker is more than a villain. 
    He is a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose moral dilemmas for his enemies.</p>
